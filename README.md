# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to convert a series of CSV files on Ride Sharing App data into more specifically organized dataframes, in an effort to analyze discrepancies in revenue between different community types.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Summary Data

### Weekly Sales by City Type

### Results
The results of our analysis were as expected. When you compare the weekly sales between city types the necessity to focus on urban areas is clear. While rural areas do have larger fares, urban riders outnumber rural riders 65:1. There can be no doubt that the abundance of drivers available in urban areas is a contributing factor. Even comparing urban communities to suburban, the number of drivers within the city outnumbers the suburbs almost 5:1. Due to the increase in riders and drivers, we see urban communities totaling $39,854.38, suburban communities came out to $19,356.33, and finally rural communities with a total of $4,327.93 in total fares. Average fare per rider is notably lower in more urban areas, likely due to shorter and more frequent trips. All of these factors contribute to the current imbalance.  

## Summary and Recommendations
With the goal in mind of closing some of the gap between Urban, Suburban, and Rural communities, perhaps the most prudent first step is increasing available drivers in the latter two options. Between January and May, there were only 78 drivers accounted for in urban communities. Convenience is the central theme for ride-sharing. Allowing the driver base to remain that small in remote communities will ensure the user base never grows. To that same end, perhaps the most concerning piece of data in this analysis is the Urban average fare per driver, coming in at $16.57 per ride. Without the average length of ride, it's difficult to say if that number is sustainable to keep a healthy driver base. In terms of the easiest market to increase profits, the answer is likely the Suburban communities. With half the sales of Urban communities, but close to a third of the rides, this seems to be the most profitable space to operate in that likely has room for growth.
